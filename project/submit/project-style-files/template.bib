abstract = {Metaheuristics are general algorithmic frameworks, often nature-inspired, designed to solve complex optimization problems, and they are a growing research area since a few decades. In recent years, metaheuristics are emerging as successful alternatives to more classical approaches also for solving optimization problems that include in their mathematical formulation uncertain, stochastic, and dynamic information. In this paper metaheuristics such as Ant Colony Optimization, Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and others are introduced, and their applications to the class of Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Problems (SCOPs) is thoroughly reviewed. Issues common to all metaheuristics, open problems, and possible directions of research are proposed and discussed. In this survey, the reader familiar to metaheuristics finds also pointers to classical algorithmic approaches to optimization under uncertainty, and useful informations to start working on this problem domain, while the reader new to metaheuristics should find a good tutorial in those metaheuristics that are currently being applied to optimization under uncertainty, and motivations for interest in this field.},

@inproceedings{Dp14,
abstract = {Recent developments in the field of-omics technologies brought great potential for conducting biomedical research in very efficient manner, but also raised a plethora of new computational challenges to be addressed. Extremely high dimensionality accompanied with poor signal-to-noise ratio and small sample size of data resulting from high-throughput experiments pose previously unprecedented problem, creating an increasing demand for innovative analytical strategies. In this work we propose an island model-based genetic algorithm for multivariate feature selection in the context of-omics data, which accommodates to a particular classification scenario via dynamic tuning of its parameters. We demonstrate it on two publicly available data sets containing gene expression profiles corresponding to the two distinct biomedical questions. We show that the algorithm consistently outperforms two additional feature selection schemes across data sets, regardless to which method is used in the subsequent classification step.},

@article{Ah17,
abstract = {Genetic algorithms are evolutionary techniques used for optimization purposes according to survival of the fittest idea. These methods do not ensure optimal solutions; however, they give good approximation usually in time. The genetic algorithms are useful for NP-hard problems, especially the traveling salesman problem. The genetic algorithm depends on selection criteria, crossover, and mutation operators. To tackle the traveling salesman problem using genetic algorithms, there are various representations such as binary, path, adjacency, ordinal, and matrix representations. In this article, we propose a new crossover operator for traveling salesman problem to minimize the total distance. This approach has been linked with path representation, which is the most natural way to represent a legal tour. Computational results are also reported with some traditional path representation methods like partially mapped and order crossovers along with new cycle crossover operator for some benchmark TSPLIB instances and found improvements.},
